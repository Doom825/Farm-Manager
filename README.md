# FARM MANAGEMENT

## Description

Our Farm Management is inspired by the need to keep track of our crops at the farm. We created this project because employeers and family members who manage the farm kept complaining of having bad communication and quick updates of the crops. We resolved the miscommunication and lack of consistency to keep track of our crops production. We learned that having an app with all the crop information, can helps us to increase a more healthy communication while we keep  everything in one place.
